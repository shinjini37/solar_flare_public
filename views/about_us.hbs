                        NumeraMusa was created by two MIT students <br>
                        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/huydpham" title="Huy's favorite number is i!"> Huy Pham </a> and

                        <br>
                        for MIT's Web Programming Competition. <br> <br>
                        The idea behind NumeraMusa was inspired by the music of &#960, <br>
                        and we wanted to enable others to create their own beautiful pieces <br>
                        from numbers special to them. <br><br>
                        
                        The name NumeraMusa was coined from the roots <br> of the words number (numerus) and music (mousa).
